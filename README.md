1. clone this repository into `~/Development` and `cd` into it
2. turn on http server `python3 -m http.server 8000`
3. **Select one** of the examples to complete (you may do more for practice, but only one is required)0

### Tasks

Separate HTML, CSS and JavaScript

1. split out HTML, CSS and JavaScript into three separate files and make sure the javascript and css are linked in the HTML
2. make sure the visualiation still works with the dummy data on your `localhost:8000`
2. commit and push to GitHub

Now we will replace the dummy data with some real data.

1. Follow the instructions in the example's README to convert an external data set into the format that this visualization is expecting. This will usually involve editing `convert.py`.
2. Commit and push to GitHub
